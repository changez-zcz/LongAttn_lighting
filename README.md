## 👀Overview

This repository contains the code for the paper "LongAttn ：Selecting Long-context Training Data via Token-level Attention"

</p>

In this work, we propose a novel token-level framework, LongAttn, which leverages the self-attention mechanism of LLMs to measure the long-range dependencies for the data. By calculating token-level dependency strength and distribution uniformity of token scores, LongAttn effectively quantifies **long-range dependencies**, enabling more accurate and efficient data selection. 

## 🔍Released Models & Datasetes
To facilitate future research in filtering long-context data, we release **LongAttn-8B** and **LongABC-32K**.
- **LongABC-32K-Raw** is a 32K-length long-context dataset obtained from the open-source **A**rxiv, **B**ook, and **C**ode data after preprocessing, with each category containing 12 billion tokens.
- **LongABC-32K** is the dataset we filtered using **LongAttn** based on LLaMA-3.1-70B from **LongABC-32K-Raw**, with each category containing 1.5 billion tokens.
- **LongAttn-8B** is the model we continual pre-trained on **LLaMA-3-8B** using **LongABC-32K**. Experiments have demonstrated that the model trained on 4.5B tokens from **LongABC-32K** outperforms the model trained on 18B tokens randomly selected from **LongABC-32K-Raw**.

The download links for the model and data are as follows:

| **LongAttn-8B** | [Coming soon]() |

## 🚀Quick Start
### Environment Setup

To use LongAttn, follow these steps to download the code and necessary dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lyun0912-wu/LongAttn.git
cd LongAttn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Pre-process
After that, the bash script `Preprocess.bash` will preprocess the pre-training data you have selected.
```
bash scripts/Preprocess.bash
```
The script performs the pipeline of Preprocess:
1. Filter parts of the pre-training data with lengths greater than 32K and perform sliding window processing on them.
2. Assign a **specific ID** to the data processed for easy identification in subsequent selection, and sample the data as needed.

### Filtering
Then, we use the script `inference_and_filter.bash` to filter the data.

```
bash scripts/inference_and_filter.bash
```
The script performs the pipeline of filtering:
1. Use the filtering model to obtain the **Attention map** for the labeled data.
2. Calculate the **$LDS_T$** indicator, and filter the data accordingly.

Finally, we obtained the data filtered by the **LongAttn** framework.

## 📑The Data Format
### Data before Preprocessing
```json
[{"content":"This is a pre-training data of variable length."}]
```

### Data after Preprocessing
```json
[{"content":"This is a pre-training data of 32K length.","data_id":"Prefix_0000001"}]
```
